Forecasting time series data is an important subject in finance. ARIMA model has demonstrated its outperformance in accuracy of predicting the next lags of time series. With the recent advancement in the machine learning domain, new forecasting models have been developed. This research investigates whether and how a particular Machine Learning forecasting model “Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)” is superior to the traditional ARIMA model. Implementation and analysis of these models have been conducted for the same.
